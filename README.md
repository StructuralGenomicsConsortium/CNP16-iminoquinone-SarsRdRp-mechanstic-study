# CNP16-iminoquinone-SarsRdRp-mechanstic-study

An [SGC]((https://www.thesgc.org/)) Open Chemistry Networks Project (number 16) devoted to the target SARS-COV-2 RdRp. 

Our current goal is to work out where is the site of Cysteine modification on the iminoquinone and how does the structure of the iminoquinone affect cysteine reactivity.

If this sounds interesting, and you agree to the simple [RULES](https://www.thesgc.org/sgc-open-chemistry-networks/terms-of-use), you can get started.
