# CNP16-iminoquinone-SarsRdRp-mechanstic-study

An [SGC]((https://www.thesgc.org/)) Open Chemistry Networks Project (number 16) devoted to the target SARS-COV-2 RdRp. 

Our current goal is to work out where is the site of Cysteine modification on the iminoquinone and how does the structure of the iminoquinone affect cysteine reactivity.

If this sounds interesting, and you agree to the simple [RULES](https://www.thesgc.org/sgc-open-chemistry-networks/terms-of-use), you can get started.

For answers to all the questions you have, go to the [FAQs](https://www.thesgc.org/sgc-open-chemistry-networks/faq).

Everything is open, with all content governed by a CC-BY-4.0 licence.

If you'd like to contact someone to talk about contributing, then write something in an Issue (see the tab above), which is a good way to communicate openly. (Issues describe what currently needs doing and act as a discussion forum - you need a Github account but it's super easy and not spammy. There's also an email address (chemistry@thesgc.org) you can use to ask questions. You can read more about all this in the ["How To"](https://github.com/StructuralGenomicsConsortium/Chemistry_TechOps_HowTo/wiki) area
